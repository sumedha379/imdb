Movies database web application

URL for the web application : http://34.74.148.170:8111/

User can search for movie by entering keywords and can search the songs. User can see the ratings of a particular searched movie .

I have created a user profile so that they can purchase movies according to prime or non-prime account and can rate the movies as well. Users can see trending movies and highly rated movies.

Two of the web pages that require the most interesting database operations are the movies page and movie info page. These two pages require the most interesting commands because they filter through the data using different keywords. The movies page allows users to search through movies with different filters such as genre, language, and by movie name. This, and the movie items access the most information from the database because the Movie table is related to almost all other tables. The movie info includes information about the movie like the actor, the rating, and the language.
